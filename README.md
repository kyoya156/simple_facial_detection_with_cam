As the name suggests, this is a simple project I made with OpenCV and faca_recognition library to try out face detection.
to try running this run main.py once first and ensure that your device has a web cam.
After running for the first time a folder known_faces_dir will be created, then just put images you want to detect inside and run for the second time.
Press Q to exit the program and S to save and capture an image (maybe the detection?)
