As the name suggests, this is a simple project I made with OpenCV and the face_recognition library to try out face detection.
to try running this run main.py once first and ensure that your device has a web cam.
After running for the first time, a folder "known_faces_dir" will be created (or you can create the same folder yourself with the same name), then just put the images of whoever you want to detect and run to try this out.

Press Q to exit the program and S to save and capture an image (maybe the detection?). You can find the saved images in a later-created folder named captured_images.
